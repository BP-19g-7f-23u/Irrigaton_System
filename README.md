# Automated Precision Irrigation System for Optimal Plant Growth using Arduino and Sensor Integration

## Overview

I aimed to develop an automated irrigation system to optimize water usage for plant growth by integrating Arduino and various sensors. The system addressed irrigation challenges, such as water logging, salinity, and inefficient water distribution, by providing precise control over water delivery. I employed advanced data structures and algorithms to enhance the system's performance and scalability.

## Goals

1. **Performance Benchmarks**: I ensured efficient water usage by maintaining soil moisture within optimal ranges.
2. **Functionalities**: I implemented real-time monitoring and control of soil moisture levels, displayed system status, and alerted users of critical conditions.
3. **Scalability**: I developed a system capable of scaling from small garden setups to larger agricultural fields.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Moisture Detection**: I utilized soil moisture sensors to measure the soil's water content.
2. **Water Pump Control**: I automated water delivery based on soil moisture levels.
3. **LCD Display**: I displayed real-time data on an LCD screen, including soil moisture, temperature, and system status.
4. **Data Logging**: I stored historical data for moisture, temperature, and system actions using linked lists.
5. **User Alerts**: I provided alerts via LED or alarms when soil moisture reached critical levels.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance Metrics**: 
   - **Time Complexity**: I ensured efficient data processing and sensor reading algorithms.
   - **Space Complexity**: I optimized memory usage for storing sensor data and historical logs.
2. **Constraints**:

## Recommended Data Structures

1. **Linked Lists**: For storing historical sensor data and ensuring quick updates.
2. **Priority Queues**: For task scheduling to ensure timely execution of critical operations.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Linked Lists

1. **Initialization and Data Insertion**: I initialized with a head pointer and inserted new nodes at the beginning.
2. **Searching and Retrieval Operations**: I traversed the list from the head to find the required data.
3. **Updating and Deleting Elements**: I updated by changing node data, deleted by adjusting pointers.
4. **Handling Edge Cases and Exceptions**: I handled cases like empty lists and single-element lists.
5. **Performance Optimizations**: I optimized by using tail pointers for append operations.

### Priority Queues

1. **Initialization and Data Insertion**: I initialized with a heap array and inserted elements while maintaining heap properties.
2. **Searching and Retrieval Operations**: I always retrieved the highest priority element from the root.
3. **Updating and Deleting Elements**: I updated by changing element priorities, deleted by removing the root and reheapifying.
4. **Handling Edge Cases and Exceptions**: I handled cases like empty heaps and full capacity.
5. **Performance Optimizations**: I optimized insertion and deletion using heapify operations.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - **Linked Lists**: I tested insertion, deletion, and traversal operations individually.
   - **Priority Queues**: I tested push, pop, and heapify operations individually.
   
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - I combined functionalities of linked lists and priority queues.
   - I tested overall system behavior with integrated components.

3. **Performance Testing**:
